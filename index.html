    <p>When you donate money, you're with us as we respond to more than 60,000 disasters each year.
    You were with us as we installed more than 2 million smoke alarms in vulnerable communities since 2014. When you donate money to the Red Cross you'll be there as we hold 500 blood drives each day, collecting 40% of the nation's supply of blood and blood products. And as we provide nearly 471,000 services to military members, veterans and their families each year.</p>
